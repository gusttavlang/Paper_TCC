  abstract = {Active magnetic regenerator (AMR) refrigerators represent an alternative
	to vapor compression technology that relies on the magnetocaloric
	effect in a solid refrigerant. Magnetocaloric materials are in development
	and properties are reported regularly. Recently, there has been an
	emphasis on developing materials with a high entropy change with
	magnetization while placing lower emphasis on the adiabatic temperature
	change. This work uses model magnetocaloric materials and a numerical
	AMR model to predict how the temperature change and entropy change
	with magnetization interact and how they affect the performance of
	a practical system. The distribution of the magnetocaloric effect
	as a function of temperature was also studied. It was found that
	the adiabatic temperature change in a magnetocaloric material can
	be more important than the isothermal entropy change for certain
	conditions. A material that exhibits a sharp peak in isothermal entropy
	change was shown to produce a significantly lower cooling power than
	a material with a wide peak in a practical AMR system. © 2010 American

  journal = {Rev. Sci. Instrum.},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {79},
  abstract = {A simple and high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimeter (DSC)
	unit operating under magnetic field has been built for indirect determination
	of the magnetocaloric effect. The principle of the measuring unit
	in the calorimeter is based on Peltier elements as heat flow sensors.
	The high sensitivity of the apparatus combined with a suitable calibration
	procedure allows very fast and accurate heat capacity measurements
	under magnetic field to be made. The device was validated from heat
	capacity measurements for the typical DSC reference material gallium
	(Ga) and a La0.67 Ca0.33 MnO3 manganite system and the results were
	highly consistent with previous reported data for these materials.
	The DSC has a working range from 200 to 340 K and has been tested
	in magnetic fields reaching 1.8 T. The signal-to-noise ratio is in
	the range of 102 - 103 for the described experiments. Finally the
	results have been compared to results from a Quantum Design physical
	properties measuring system. The configuration of the system also
	has the advantage of being able to operate with other types of magnets,
	e.g., permanent magnets or superconducting coils, as well as the
	ability to be expanded to a wider temperature range. © 2008 American

  abstract = {Abstract Most of the existing prototype devices for magnetic refrigeration are based on a thermodynamic cycle with an active magnetic regenerator (AMR) that operates as a Brayton-type regenerative magnetic refrigeration cycle. However, there are several other cycles that may potentially influence not only the efficiency, but also the cost, compactness and simplicity of magnetocaloric devices. In this article we discuss the possibility of introducing new thermodynamic cycles. This is supported by information about, and a comparison of, the corresponding magnetic field sources. We present the results of numerical analyses and compare the characteristics of different thermodynamic cycles under different operating conditions and for different magnetic field intensities. Guidelines for future work on new magnetic thermodynamic cycles are presented. },
